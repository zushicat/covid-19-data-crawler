# covid-19-data-crawler
Get latest data updates of covid-19 numbers from different sources (with focus on Germany as of now).

There is quite a gap between the overall numbers from Rober Koch Institute and (well respected) news outlets, hence this data crawler of different sources (as of now with focus on Germany).   

## Crawled Sources

### 1 Robert Koch Institute (RKI)
https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd4580c810204019a7b8eb3e0b329dd6_0/geoservice  

Requested attributes:
- AnzahlFall
- AnzahlTodesfall
- Meldedatum (is timestamp)
- IdLandkreis
- IdBundesland
- Landkreis

### 2 Stadt KÃ¶ln (Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany)
Scrape datatable of the overview page:
https://www.stadt-koeln.de/leben-in-koeln/gesundheit/infektionsschutz/corona-virus/corona-virus-anzahl-der-bestaetigten-faelle-koeln

### 3 News outlets
Zeit Online (ZON), Berliner Morgenpost

#### a - The API by jgehrcke
Numbers on state level (which I additionally accumulated to national level)
For details, see: https://github.com/jgehrcke/covid-19-germany-gae

#### b - ZON
ZON now additionally delivers international and community level data (see comments with JSON links in /get_latest_case_data/_get_ZON_data.py) which I both request.


**All data is enriched with additional data (ISO state/country codes and information about population numbers/density).**

## Usage
If you like to request the data yourself, just call request_data.py. Csv files are then saved in a directory named by date of request.
